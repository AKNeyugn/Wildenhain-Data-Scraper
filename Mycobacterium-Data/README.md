# CompoundStructure.py

For each compound in given library, convert SMILES string into 3D structure and output .pdb file.

**Module requirements:**

- OpenBabel (http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page)
- pandas (pip install pandas)

**How to run:** *python CompoundStructure.py library_SMILES_file single_file*
- library_SMILES_file: path from current working directory to SMILES file of library to process (eg. Data-Files\compounds.csv)
- single_file: "true" if want output to be single file containing all compounds info for each library

**Outputs:**
- *Compound-3D-Structure* folder containing seperate .pdb files of each compounds in given library
- if running with single_file = "true", *Compound-3D-Structure* folder will also contain .pdb file containing all compounds info for each library

**Note:**
Expected compounds with failed 3D structure conversion due to missing SMILES:
- U14272896
- U20739209
- U21835532
- U32963902
- U84341231
- nan

The files for these compounds are manually moved to seperate *nan-SMILES* folder

**Note:**
.pdb file containing all compounds info is not uploaded to repository due to its large size

# CGMProcess.py

Read both chemogenomic data files (A-M and N-Z) and create CGM .csv file.

If run with inputs for both z_score_cutoff and p_value_cutoff, cell values in CGM will be binary (1 if input values pass z_score AND p_value cutoffs, 0 otherwise). In this case, output file will be named "Full_CGM_*z_score_cutoff*_*p_value_cutoff*.csv";

Otherwise, will create 2 CGM files: one where cell values are z_scores and another where cell values are p_values. In this case, z_score matrix will be name "Full_CGM_Z_score.csv" and p_value matrix will be named "Full_CGM_P_value.csv"

**Module requirements:**

- pandas (pip install pandas)

**How to run:** *python CGMProcess.py z_score_cutoff p_value_cutoff*
- z_score_cutoff: cutoff for z_score
- p_value_cutoff: cutoff for p_value 

**Outputs:**
- *CGM* folder containing .csv files

**Note:**
Need to input both z_score_cutoff and p_value_cutoff to have CGM with filtered binary values

**Note:**
CGM output is a compound vs gene matrix, where x-axis = gene and y-axis = compound

**Note:**

*A-M (input):*

- Total # rows: 4636478
- Unique compound rows with non n/a compound_stem and experiments at 50 micromolar: 47202
- Unique strain rows: 98

*N-Z (input):*

- Total # rows: 2696727
- Unique compound rows with non n/a compound_stem and experiments at 50 micromolar: 47202
- Unique strain rows: 57

*Full (output):*

- Total # rows (compounds): 47246
- Total # columns (strains): 155
- Unique compound rows with non n/a compound_stem and experiments at 50 micromolar: 47202

**Note:**
Input files, as well as output files, are not uploaded to repository due to their large size

# KMeansCluster.r

K-means clustering analysis of CGM. The script will plot withing groups sum of squares against number of clusters (elbow method) for user to manually determine number of clusters to use in clustering. It will also generate a heatmap of clustering results.

**Note:**
To change the number of clusters used in analysis, as well as input and output files, the user must modify the code itself.
